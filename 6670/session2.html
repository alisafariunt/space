                <p>IS was built on the idea that both social and technical parts matter equally and should be studied
                    together. But this is no longer happening. The authors reviewed 991 papers from MISQ and ISR between
                    2000-2016.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "About 56% of research is mostly social (Type I), only 7% is mostly technical (Type VI), and only
                    13% actually examines how social and technical interact (Type IV). Also, 91% of studies focus only
                    on instrumental outcomes (efficiency) and ignore humanistic outcomes (ethics, well-being)."

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <span class="analysis-label">5. Resolution</span>

                <h4>What is an "Axis of Cohesion"?</h4>
                <p>The authors borrow Andrew Abbott's concept of <mark>"axis of cohesion"</mark> from sociology. An axis
                    of cohesion is a shared frame that holds a discipline together. It provides three things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Common language:</strong> Words and concepts everyone in the field understands</li>
                    <li><strong>Research orientation:</strong> A shared way of thinking about problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Communal knowledge:</strong> Core ideas that everyone builds upon</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For IS, the sociotechnical perspective should serve as this axis. It means studying both technical
                    artifacts AND the social context (individuals, groups, organizations) together, treating neither as
                    more important than the other.</p>

                <h4>Historical Context: Where Did Sociotechnical Come From?</h4>
                <p>The sociotechnical perspective has roots in the Tavistock Institute studies of British coal mines in
                    the 1950s. Researchers noticed that introducing new mining technology failed when they ignored how
                    workers were organized socially. The lesson: <em>technology and social structure must be designed
                        together.</em></p>
                <p>IS as a field adopted this perspective from its founding. Early IS scholars like Enid Mumford, Rob
                    Kling, and Claudio Ciborra emphasized that information systems are not just technical tools but are
                    embedded in social practices. However, over time, this balance has been lost.</p>

                <h4>Three Core Observations from the Literature Review</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Uneven emphasis:</strong> Research does not balance social and technical. Most IS
                        research is social-dominant (Type I). Very little is technical-dominant (Type VI). The middle
                        (Type IV) is rare.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited relationship types:</strong> When social and technical are both present, the
                        relationship is usually just "fit" or "joint optimization." Authors argue for accepting more
                        varied relationships: contextual, inscribed, imbricated, disharmonious, role-reversal, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Instrumental focus (91%):</strong> Almost all research focuses on efficiency,
                        productivity, performance. Only 9% considers humanistic outcomes like well-being, equality,
                        freedom, or ethics.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Three Recommendations</h4>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Recommendation 1: Social-Technical Continuum</h4>
                    <p>Don't require every study to be in the middle. Instead, accept research anywhere on the continuum
                        from predominantly social (Type I) to predominantly technical (Type VI). But:</p>
                    <ul>

                <p>IS research lacks good theories about what digital objects fundamentally are. We talk about digital
                    technology all the time, but we don't really understand their basic nature.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Orlikowski and Iacono (2001) showed that IS research under-theorizes the IT artifact. Follow-up
                    studies (up to 2015) show this hasn't changed much. Most IS research either ignores what IT
                    artifacts really are, treats them as simple tools, or reduces them to proxy measures. Only about
                    12-21% use the 'ensemble view' that properly considers technology complexity."

                        affirms that digital objects have inherent properties that matter organizationally. For example:

                        <li><strong>Nonmaterial objects don't degrade</strong> with use (unlike physical things)</li>
                        <li><strong>They can be copied infinitely</strong> at near-zero cost (non-rivalry)</li>
                        <li><strong>The same file can exist in many places</strong> at once</li>
                        <li><strong>They don't wear out</strong> - no "lemons problem" for used digital goods</li>

                <h4>Bitstrings: The Foundation of Digital Computing</h4>
                <p>A <mark>bitstring</mark> is a syntactic object made of 0s and 1s, structured according to a file
                    format that makes it readable by computer hardware. Almost all information on silicon-based
                    computers is encoded in bitstrings.</p>

                    <h4>Practical Example: Secondary Markets for Downloaded Bitstrings</h4>
                    <p>The authors use the bearer theory to analyze a real legal dispute: Can you resell a "used" MP3

                        <p><strong>Background:</strong> ReDigi created a "Cloud Locker" where users could upload and
                            sell
                            their iTunes purchases. Capitol Records sued.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ruling:</strong> <mark>Unlawful</mark>. Uploading to Cloud Locker creates a new
                            material
                            bearer (server copy) = copyright violation. The original "first sale" was for one copy, not
                            the
                            right to make new copies.</p>

                        <h4>UsedSoft v. Oracle (EU, 2012)</h4>
                        <p><strong>Context:</strong> UsedSoft resold Oracle software licenses that customers no longer
                            needed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ruling:</strong> <mark>Lawful</mark>. Creating a new material bearer is acceptable
                            reproduction if it's necessary for use and the original is deleted. "Exhaustion of
                            distribution
                            right" applies to downloaded software.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Why the difference?</strong> The US court focused on the new material bearer being a
                        copy.
                        The EU court focused on the economic value transfer.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Resource-Based View:</strong> Knowledge resources can be embedded in layers:
                            knowledge
                            in text in DOCX in ZIP in server. Each layer has different properties (accessibility,
                            transferability).</li>
                        <li><strong>Knowledge-Based View:</strong> "Resource liquefaction" (decoupling info from
                            physical
                            form) requires understanding bearer layers and translational actions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service-Dominant Logic:</strong> Expand "operand resources" to include nonmaterial
                            objects like software, files, and protocols. Embedding patterns can be complex (operant in
                            operand, operand in operand, etc.).</li>

                <p>IS use research has always assumed humans are in control and technology is a passive tool. But now we

                <p>Drawing from Russell & Norvig (2010): An <mark>agent</mark> is "something that perceives and acts in
                    an environment." This definition applies to both humans and AI systems.</p>

                <h4>What are Agentic IS Artifacts?</h4>
                <p><mark>Agentic IS artifacts</mark> are rational software-based agents that can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Perceive</strong> their environment through sensors/inputs</li>
                    <li><strong>Act</strong> autonomously without direct human intervention</li>
                    <li><strong>Accept rights</strong> for task execution</li>
                    <li><strong>Accept responsibilities</strong> for preferred outcomes</li>
                    <li><strong>Make rational decisions</strong> to achieve best expected outcome</li>

                    <p>As we move toward prescriptive archetypes, the AI takes over more decision-making. This raises
                        critical questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do we evaluate AI's capability before delegating?</li>
                        <li>What happens when the AI makes a mistake?</li>
                        <li>Who is responsible for outcomes?</li>

                <h4>Multi-Agent Perspectives (Future Research)</h4>
                <p>The paper identifies three directions for extending the framework:</p>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>1. Triadic Perspective: The Designer</h4>
                    <p>The AI designer has been ignored but matters enormously:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designer's values are encoded in AI's decision model</li>
                        <li>AI may serve designer interests (e.g., advertisers) over user interests</li>
                        <li>If user suspects AI loyalty is to designer, delegation may be impeded</li>
                        <li>Key question: <em>Whose interests does the AI really serve?</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>2. Agentic IS Platforms</h4>
                    <p>Multiple AI agents working together on platforms:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Autonomous vehicle = platform with navigation, entertainment, safety AIs</li>
                        <li>IoT ecosystems = many devices with different capabilities</li>
                        <li>Third-party agents on platforms may have conflicting interests</li>
                        <li>Cooperation AND competition within platforms</li>
                        <li>Key question: <em>How do dependencies between agents affect reliability?</em></li>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>3. Recipients and Ethics</h4>
                    <p>The person affected by delegation (recipient) is often ignored:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Patient being operated on by surgeon + AI</li>
                        <li>Whose interests are prioritized?</li>
                        <li>Transparency about AI decision logic</li>
                        <li>Corporate secrecy may hide ethically dubious actions (Burrell 2016, Zuboff 2019)</li>
                        <li>Key question: <em>How will ethics play a role in delegation appraisal?</em></li>

                    <li><strong>Trust as part of Appraisal:</strong> Trust is how humans evaluate whether to delegate to

                    <li><strong>Bidirectional delegation:</strong> AI can delegate back to humans (role reversal)</li>
                    <li><strong>The dyad as unit of analysis:</strong> Study the human-AI pair, not just the human</li>
                    <li><strong>Archetypes matter:</strong> Different levels of AI agency require different trust

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>AI-Native Development Platforms:</strong> Tools that use AI to create software faster.

                        <li><strong>Physical AI:</strong> When AI acts in the physical world, trust becomes even more
                            critical because mistakes have real consequences.</li>

                    important for IS?</span>
                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>The "axis of cohesion" is a concept borrowed from sociologist Andrew Abbott, referring to a
                        shared intellectual frame that provides a discipline with common language, research orientation,
                        and communal knowledge (Sarker et al., 2019). For IS, Sarker and colleagues argue this axis
                        should be the <strong>sociotechnical perspective</strong>, which considers both technical
                        artifacts and social contexts together, privileging neither.</p>
                    <p>The axis of cohesion matters for three critical reasons. First, it provides <strong>disciplinary
                            distinctiveness</strong>. Without a unique perspective, IS risks having its territory
                        claimed by other fields like computer science or management (Sarker et al., 2019). Second, it
                        enables <strong>coherent expansion</strong>. As IS grows into new areas, a shared axis prevents
                        fragmentation into disconnected silos that cannot communicate. Third, it guards against
                        <strong>ethical abdication</strong>. By maintaining focus on both humanistic outcomes
                        (well-being, freedom) and instrumental outcomes (efficiency), IS avoids contributing to a
                        dehumanized society as imagined in dystopian literature like Orwell's 1984 (Sarker et al.,
                        2019).

                    13%?</span>
                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>Sarker et al. (2019) found that only 13% of papers in their review of 991 articles from MISQ and
                        ISR (2000-2016) demonstrated Type IV research, where social and technical elements genuinely
                        interact and mutually shape each other. This rarity reflects several structural problems in IS
                        research.</p>
                    <p>First, <strong>methodological challenges</strong> make true sociotechnical research difficult.
                        Studying dynamic interplay between technology and social systems requires longitudinal designs,
                        mixed methods, and theoretical frameworks that can accommodate mutual causation rather than
                        simple independent-dependent variable relationships (Sarker et al., 2019).</p>
                    <p>Second, <strong>incentive structures</strong> may discourage Type IV research. Studies at the
                        extremes (Type I and Type VI) are often easier to execute and publish because they follow
                        established templates from reference disciplines, whether organizational behavior or computer
                        science.</p>
                    <p>Third, <strong>disciplinary training</strong> often emphasizes one side. Researchers trained in
                        behavioral traditions may default to Type I work, while those from technical backgrounds
                        gravitate toward Type VI. The integration required for Type IV demands expertise in both domains
                        (Sarker et al., 2019).</p>
                    <p>This imbalance matters because Type IV research is precisely what makes IS distinctive. Without
                        it, IS becomes either sociology with technology context or engineering without user
                        consideration.</p>

                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>According to Faulkner and Runde (2019), nonmaterial objects like software, protocols, and digital
                        files cannot exist independently and must be "borne" by other objects to be accessed. The theory
                        distinguishes two types of bearers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Material bearers</strong> are physical objects with spatial attributes (mass, volume,
                        location) that carry nonmaterial objects. Examples include hard drives storing files, screens
                        displaying text, paper holding printed documents, and human memory retaining procedures.
                        Material bearers exist in physical space and are subject to degradation, damage, and location
                        constraints (Faulkner & Runde, 2019).</p>
                    <p><strong>Nonmaterial bearers</strong> are syntactic objects, particularly bitstrings, that carry
                        other nonmaterial objects. A DOCX file (bitstring) bears an English text, which bears a testing
                        protocol. The key innovation is recognizing that bitstrings can bear other syntactic objects,
                        enabling <strong>unlimited layering</strong>: protocol → text → DOCX → ZIP → hard drive
                        (Faulkner & Runde, 2019).</p>
                    <p>This distinction has profound implications. The same nonmaterial object can have multiple
                        simultaneous material bearers in different locations. Each bearer layer has distinct properties,
                        so the text is not the same as the DOCX bearing it. Translational actions (encoding,
                        compressing, storing) are required to move between layers.</p>

                <span class="analysis-label">Q4: How does the bearer theory help us understand the nature of AI
                    systems?</span>
                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>Faulkner and Runde's (2019) bearer theory provides a rigorous ontological foundation for
                        understanding AI systems as <strong>hybrid objects</strong> combining material and nonmaterial
                        components.</p>
                    <p>AI systems involve multiple bearer layers. The AI's model (nonmaterial) is borne by bitstrings
                        (nonmaterial bearer), which are borne by storage hardware (material bearer). Training data,
                        algorithms, and outputs each exist at different bearer layers with distinct properties. This
                        layered understanding helps explain why AI "knowledge" can be instantiated across multiple
                        physical systems simultaneously, yet remains the same knowledge (Faulkner & Runde, 2019).</p>
                    <p>The theory also illuminates <strong>computation</strong> as the real-time algorithmic
                        manipulation of information in bitstrings. For AI, computation is not merely processing but an
                        existential relationship where the AI model depends on computational processes to function,
                        while computation requires the model to have something to process (Faulkner & Runde, 2019).</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, <strong>social positioning</strong> explains how AI acquires its identity and
                        function within organizational systems. An AI doesn't inherently have a "role"; it acquires
                        social identity through positioning in institutional contexts, just like human actors. This
                        connects to Baird and Maruping's (2021) work on agentic artifacts and their place in
                        sociotechnical systems.</p>

                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>Baird and Maruping (2021) identify four archetypes of agentic IS artifacts arranged along a
                        continuum from limited to expansive decision-making scope.</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Reflexive (Reactive):</strong> These artifacts act reflexively to stimuli according to
                        predefined behavioral models. They involve no real "reasoning." Examples include motion sensors,
                        basic voice assistants responding to queries, and simple alerting systems. Decision scope is
                        limited to triggering predetermined responses (Baird & Maruping, 2021).</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Supervisory (Control System):</strong> These artifacts evaluate deviations from norms
                        and guide decision-making or take corrective action. Examples include behavior modification
                        apps, GPS navigation that recalculates routes, and smart thermostats. They have moderate
                        decision scope involving monitoring and adjustment (Baird & Maruping, 2021).</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Anticipatory (Proactive):</strong> These artifacts proactively anticipate user needs
                        using model-based "reasoning" without being explicitly asked. Examples include social media feed
                        curation, automatic photo albums, and predictive text completion. They have substantial decision
                        scope involving prediction and proactive intervention (Baird & Maruping, 2021).</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Prescriptive (Autonomous):</strong> These artifacts act as substitutes for human
                        decision-making by prescribing or taking autonomous actions. Examples include chatbots,
                        autonomous vehicles, robo-advisors, and medical diagnosis AI. This archetype raises the most
                        significant trust and delegation concerns due to its expansive decision scope.</p>

                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>Baird and Maruping (2021) argue that traditional IS use theories are inadequate for agentic AI
                        systems, and propose <strong>delegation</strong> as the core organizing concept instead.</p>
                    <p>Traditional use theories like TAM, UTAUT, and Task-Technology Fit assume humans are always in
                        control, applying technology as a tool. The terminology of "use" implies a human actor
                        manipulating a passive instrument. These theories focus heavily on user perceptions (perceived
                        usefulness, ease of use) rather than artifact capabilities. The unit of analysis is the
                        individual user (Baird & Maruping, 2021).</p>
                    <p><strong>Delegation</strong> fundamentally differs by recognizing that rights and responsibilities
                        can be transferred between agents, whether human or AI. Key distinctions include: (1)
                        <strong>Roles are interchangeable</strong>, either party can be delegator or proxy; (2)
                        <strong>Bidirectional flow</strong>, AI can delegate to humans (like code review bots assigning
                        tasks); (3) <strong>Tasks can be ambiguous and dynamic</strong>, not just well-defined
                        operations; (4) <strong>Unit of analysis is the dyad</strong>, the human-AI pair rather than
                        just the human (Baird & Maruping, 2021).
                    </p>
                    <p>This matters for AI research because it accommodates scenarios where AI systems operate
                        autonomously, make decisions, and even direct human action, which use-centered theories cannot
                        adequately theorize.</p>

                    research?</span>
                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>Based on Gartner's Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2026, three trends appear particularly
                        impactful for IS research.</p>
                    <p><strong>Multiagent Systems</strong> (1445% increase in Gartner inquiries) represents the most
                        significant development. As autonomous AI agents collaborate and compete within integrated
                        platforms, IS researchers must extend delegation theory beyond human-AI dyads to multi-agent
                        ecosystems. Questions of trust, coordination, and accountability become exponentially more
                        complex when multiple AI agents interact (Gartner, 2025).</p>
                    <p><strong>Physical AI</strong> brings previously abstract AI concepts into tangible form (robots,
                        autonomous vehicles, smart infrastructure). When AI mistakes have real-world physical
                        consequences, trust and risk perception research takes on new urgency. The stakes of delegation
                        decisions increase dramatically when failures can cause physical harm (Gartner, 2025).</p>
                    <p><strong>AI Security</strong> addresses vulnerabilities in AI systems that go beyond traditional
                        cybersecurity. Prompt injection, model manipulation, and adversarial attacks require new
                        theoretical frameworks for understanding technological trust. This connects directly to Baird
                        and Maruping's (2021) appraisal mechanism, where agents must evaluate each other's reliability
                        (Gartner, 2025).</p>
                    <p>These trends suggest IS research must rapidly develop theories for multi-agent coordination,
                        embodied AI trust, and security in delegation contexts.</p>

                    AI?</span>
                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>Multiagent systems fundamentally transform trust considerations by introducing
                        <strong>inter-agent trust</strong> alongside human-AI trust. Traditional trust research focuses
                        on whether humans should trust AI recommendations. In multiagent systems, researchers must also
                        consider whether AI agents should trust each other (Gartner, 2025).
                    </p>
                    <p>Baird and Maruping's (2021) delegation framework suggests several implications. First,
                        <strong>appraisal becomes multilayered</strong>. Humans must evaluate not just individual AI
                        agents but the entire agent ecosystem, including how agents evaluate each other. Second,
                        <strong>coordination complexity increases</strong>. When agents delegate tasks among themselves
                        before presenting results to humans, the human may not understand the provenance of
                        recommendations (Baird & Maruping, 2021).
                    </p>
                    <p>Third, the <strong>triadic perspective</strong> becomes inadequate. Baird and Maruping note that
                        AI designers embed values into systems. With multiple agents from multiple designers
                        interacting, value conflicts may emerge that are opaque to users. Fourth, <strong>accountability
                            diffuses</strong>. When an AI recommendation fails, identifying the responsible agent in a
                        multiagent chain becomes challenging (Baird & Maruping, 2021).</p>
                    <p>Future trust research must develop frameworks for evaluating multiagent ecosystems holistically,
                        not just individual agents. This requires extending trust theory beyond dyadic relationships to
                        network-level analysis.</p>

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <span class="analysis-label">Q9: What is the sociotechnical perspective and why does Sarker argue it
                    matters?</span>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>The <strong>sociotechnical perspective</strong> considers technical artifacts AND
                        individuals/collectives in social contexts together, privileging neither (Sarker et al., 2019).
                        It originated at the Tavistock Institute in 1950s Britain through studies of coal mining, where
                        researchers discovered that optimizing technology alone without considering social systems led
                        to failure.</p>
                    <p>Sarker argues this perspective matters because it provides IS with disciplinary distinctiveness.
                        The perspective espouses focus on both <strong>instrumental outcomes</strong> (efficiency,
                        productivity) and <strong>humanistic outcomes</strong> (well-being, equality, freedom). Without
                        this dual focus, IS risks either becoming pure engineering that ignores human consequences or
                        pure social science that fails to theorize technology deeply (Sarker et al., 2019).</p>
                    <p>The perspective should serve as the "axis of cohesion" providing a shared frame for the
                        discipline. Without it, IS faces erosion (other fields claiming IS territory), fragmentation
                        (silos that cannot communicate), and ethical abdication (contributing to dehumanized societies).

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>A <strong>bitstring</strong> is a syntactic object made of 0s and 1s structured according to a
                        file format, readable by computer hardware (Faulkner & Runde, 2019). Virtually all information
                        on silicon-based computers is encoded in bitstrings.</p>
                    <p>Bitstrings come in two types: <strong>Program files</strong> encode logical operations (operating
                        systems, applications, games), while <strong>Data files</strong> encode data (documents, images,
                        videos). The structure of each bitstring is determined by its file format.</p>
                    <p>Bitstrings matter for ontological theory because they can serve as <strong>nonmaterial
                            bearers</strong> of other nonmaterial objects. A DOCX bitstring bears text, which bears
                        meaning. This enables unlimited layering of bearers, a defining feature of digital technology
                        that distinguishes it from analog information storage. Understanding bitstrings helps explain
                        properties of digital objects like perfect reproducibility, zero marginal cost of copying, and
                        simultaneous existence in multiple locations (Faulkner & Runde, 2019).</p>

                <span class="analysis-label">Q11: What are the 3 foundational mechanisms of IS delegation?</span>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>Baird and Maruping (2021) identify three foundational mechanisms through which delegation
                        operates:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Appraisal:</strong> Agents evaluate each other and the situation before delegation
                        occurs. This includes assessing the other party's endowments (abilities, resources), preferences
                        (goals, values), and roles. Trust is part of appraisal: positive evaluation of the other party's
                        capabilities and intentions. Cost-benefit analysis also occurs here (Baird & Maruping, 2021).
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>2. Distribution:</strong> How rights and responsibilities are allocated between parties.
                        This includes decisions about what rights are retained versus transferred, what level of
                        oversight the delegator maintains, and how accountability is structured. Distribution can range
                        from full delegation to heavily monitored partial delegation (Baird & Maruping, 2021).</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Coordination:</strong> How agents work together after delegation occurs. This includes
                        monitoring mechanisms, feedback loops, updating arrangements as circumstances change, and
                        adapting to unexpected situations. Effective coordination requires continued communication and
                        mutual adjustment (Baird & Maruping, 2021).</p>

                <span class="analysis-label">Q12: How did US and EU rule differently on secondary markets for downloaded
                    bitstrings?</span>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>Faulkner and Runde (2019) use contrasting legal decisions to illustrate how bearer theory has
                        practical implications for digital commerce.</p>
                    <p><strong>US (Capitol Records v. ReDigi, 2013):</strong> The court ruled that when a user uploads a
                        music file to a cloud locker for resale, they necessarily create a new material bearer (new copy
                        on new server). This constitutes copyright violation regardless of whether the original is
                        deleted. Therefore, secondary market resale of downloaded music is <span
                            style="color: red;"><strong>unlawful</strong></span> in the US.</p>
                    <p><strong>EU (UsedSoft v. Oracle, 2012):</strong> The court ruled that creating a new material
                        bearer is acceptable lawful reproduction if it is necessary for use and the original is deleted.
                        The First Sale Doctrine applies to digital goods just as to physical goods. Therefore, secondary
                        market resale of downloaded software is <span
                            style="color: green;"><strong>lawful</strong></span> in the EU.</p>
                    <p>The core philosophical difference: Is creating a new bearer inherently an illegal reproduction,
                        or is it acceptable if functionally equivalent to transferring a physical object? Bearer theory
                        helps articulate exactly what happens in these transactions (Faulkner & Runde, 2019).</p>

                    نظریه خوبی درباره ماهیت IT artifact ندارد. Orlikowski & Iacono (2001) این را نشان دادند و هنوز
                    ۷۰-۸۸٪ مقالات IT را under-theorize می‌کنند.</p>

                <h4>Bitstring چیست؟</h4>
                <p>یک شیء نحوی (syntactic object) از ۰ و ۱ که طبق یک فرمت فایل ساختاربندی شده. تقریباً تمام اطلاعات روی
                    کامپیوترها به صورت bitstring ذخیره می‌شود.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Program files:</strong> دستورالعمل‌ها را encode می‌کنند (سیستم عامل، اپلیکیشن)</li>
                    <li><strong>Data files:</strong> داده‌ها را encode می‌کنند (تصویر، ویدیو، سند)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>نظریه حامل (Bearer Theory) - نوآوری اصلی!</h4>
                <p>اشیاء غیرمادی باید روی چیزی "حمل" شوند تا قابل دسترسی باشند:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>حامل مادی:</strong> هارد دیسک فایل‌ها را ذخیره می‌کند، صفحه نمایش متن را نشان می‌دهد

                        حمل می‌کند)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>مثال لایه‌ها:</strong></p>
                <p style="direction: ltr; text-align: center; background: #f0f0f0; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;">
                    پروتکل تست ← متن انگلیسی ← فایل DOCX ← آرشیو ZIP ← هارد دیسک

                <p><strong>نکته کلیدی:</strong> هر لایه ویژگی‌های خودش را دارد! پروتکل ≠ متن ≠ DOCX ≠ ZIP</p>

                <h4>Translational Actions (اقدامات ترجمه‌ای)</h4>

                        نظارت؟</li>
                    <li><strong>هماهنگی (Coordination):</strong> پس از تفویض چگونه با هم کار می‌کنند؟ نظارت،

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Triadic (سه‌گانه):</strong> طراح AI هم مهم است! ارزش‌های طراح در مدل تصمیم AI encode
                        شده. AI ممکن است به نفع طراح (مثلاً تبلیغ‌دهنده) عمل کند نه کاربر.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agentic Platforms:</strong> چندین AI روی یک پلتفرم. مثال: خودروی خودران = ناوبری +
                        سرگرمی + ایمنی. همکاری و رقابت همزمان!</li>
                    <li><strong>Recipients & Ethics:</strong> شخص تحت تأثیر (مثلاً بیمار) اغلب نادیده گرفته می‌شود.
                        شفافیت منطق AI مهم است.</li>
