                <p>To provide a <mark>practical guide for IS researchers</mark> who want to write better papers,
                    especially theory papers. The paper teaches the essential elements that every IS paper needs to
                    communicate clearly.</p>
                <p>The core objective is to produce an article that is <strong>enjoyable to read</strong>,
                    <strong>changes what the reader knows</strong>, and is <strong>not cognitively taxing</strong>. This
                    is achieved through clear structural principles and a methodical writing process.

                    <p>A paper must follow a <mark>"focused and continuously connected set of ideas from start to
                            finish."</mark> The logical arguments should not fray, ensuring the reader is not confused
                        by a disjointed narrative.</p>
                    <p><strong>What this means:</strong> Every paragraph should connect logically to the previous one.
                        If you cut a paragraph and the paper still makes sense, that paragraph probably should not be
                        there.</p>

                <p>IS researchers, especially doctoral students and early-career scholars who are learning how to write
                    publishable research papers.</p>

                <span class="analysis-label">3. Problem</span>
                <p>Many IS papers fail in the review process because they don't clearly communicate certain essential
                    elements. Authors often don't know what these elements are or how to present them effectively.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "A good IS paper... needs to communicate five essential things clearly. These five elements are: the
                    area of focus, the relevant background, the theoretical tension, the resolution of that tension, and
                    guidelines for future application. If any of these pieces is missing or unclear, the paper will
                    struggle in the review process."

                        there is heterogeneity based on Z." This is strong because it directly addresses why prior work

                    <h4>Why Introduction Last?</h4>
                    <p>The Introduction is the hardest section to write and also the most read. It's easier to write
                        once you know what the rest of your paper actually says. Don't waste hours perfecting an intro
                        for a paper whose direction may still change.</p>

            <div class="analysis-section">
                <span class="analysis-label">The 5-Step Structured Writing Process (Detailed)</span>
                <p>A disciplined, step-by-step process can demystify the writing of both theoretical and empirical
                    papers:</p>

                <h4>Step 1: Plan and Outline</h4>
                <p>Begin by using a planning worksheet to draft sentences for each of the five core communication areas.
                    Expand these notes into a detailed manuscript outline, paying attention to the target journal's
                    formatting requirements from the outset.</p>

                <h4>Step 2: Draft from the Middle Out</h4>
                <p>For the first draft, it is most effective to write the core sections first: Background, Theory
                    Building/Methods, and New Theory Development/Results. The Introduction, typically the most difficult
                    section, should be written last, along with the Conclusion and Abstract.</p>

                <h4>Step 3: Utilize Synthesis Tables</h4>
                <p>In the literature review section, create a synthesis table to organize prior research thematically.
                    This is a valuable exercise for clarifying the paper's perspective on existing literature, even if
                    the table is removed from the final version.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>Literature Review Best Practice</h4>
                    <p>A literature review should be an <mark>"evidence-based editorial"</mark>, not just a list of
                        facts.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use synthesis tables with columns: research area, description, citations</li>
                        <li>Use <strong>"string citations"</strong> to save space (e.g., Author1, 2018; Author2, 2019)
                        </li>
                        <li>Demonstrate common ground with your target subcommunity</li>
                        <li>Include both classic and recent works</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>Step 4: Create Results Tables and Figures First</h4>
                <p>Before writing the full paper, create the tables and figures for the Results section. This ensures
                    the primary findings are finalized, preventing extensive rewriting later.</p>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>Results Section Rules</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stick to facts</strong> - reserve interpretation for the Discussion</li>
                        <li><mark>"Rookie mistake"</mark> = introducing new constructs or relationships for the first
                            time in the Results section</li>
                        <li>Create tables and figures BEFORE writing the prose around them</li>
                        <li>Emulate model papers that use similar methods</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>Step 5: Iterate and Revise Consistently</h4>
                <p>Academic writing is an iterative process. An <strong>"agile" approach</strong>, involving frequent
                    sharing and collective revision with co-authors, is preferable to a "waterfall" method where a
                    "finished" paper is presented.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Revise, revise, revise... Be obsessed with incrementally improving."
                    <cite>— Baird (2021)</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>After the full draft is complete, the paper must be reread and <strong>"tightened" at least three
                        times</strong> to remove extraneous text and clarify the "red thread."</p>

                <p>Baird uses his own paper as an example of <mark>assumption challenging</mark>:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "The traditional assumption was that end-users are always the primary agents when interacting with
                    IS artifacts. But with AI and automation, this assumption no longer holds. Now, agentic IS artifacts
                    (like routing systems telling delivery drivers where to go) can direct human agents."
                </blockquote>
                <p>If we do not challenge this assumption, we risk not understanding how human-technology relationships
                    are evolving. This example shows how good theory comes from questioning what everyone takes for
                    granted.</p>

                    <li><strong>Fatal flaws:</strong> Fundamental problems with the research question, invalid methods,
                        or lack of contribution. Cannot be fixed in revision.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fixable issues:</strong> Presentation problems, missing literature, unclear
                        explanations. Can be addressed with developmental feedback.</li>

                <p>Expert "diamond cutters" can help camouflage some errors, but most fatal flaws are impossible to

                <p>The IS field often talks about the importance of making novel contributions, but this term is poorly
                    defined and inconsistently applied. Different reviewers have different opinions, and authors

                <blockquote>
                    "Novelty should not be evaluated in isolation. Instead, it needs to be balanced with two other
                    values: rigor (doing the research correctly) and relevance (making the research matter to someone)."

                    <p>The pursuit of novelty can undermine rigor in these ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Speculative theorizing</strong> without sufficient validation</li>

                            retroactively "explaining" them as if predicted</li>

                            existing ones (e.g., "digital trust" vs. plain "trust")</li>
                        <li><strong>"Methodological fireworks without conceptual fire"</strong> - complex methods that
                            don't add insight</li>

                <span class="analysis-label">Q1: What are the five elements every IS paper must communicate according to
                    Baird?</span>
                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>According to Baird (2021), every IS theory paper must communicate five essential elements to be
                        effective. First, <strong>Focus</strong> establishes the phenomena of interest and the
                        theoretical lens through which it will be examined. Second, <strong>Background</strong> provides
                        the theoretical and empirical context, positioning the paper within existing literature and
                        establishing what "commonsense" knowledge exists.</p>
                    <p>Third, and most critically, <strong>Tension</strong> identifies the problem the paper addresses.
                        Baird (2021) argues that the strongest tensions come from "assumption challenging" rather than
                        mere "gap spotting." This means questioning fundamental assumptions in existing literature
                        rather than simply noting what has not been studied. Fourth, <strong>Resolution</strong>
                        presents the theoretical contribution that addresses the identified tension. This is the core
                        value proposition of the paper.</p>
                    <p>Finally, <strong>Guidelines</strong> describe how the theory should be applied in future research
                        or practice. These elements work together as a coherent narrative. Baird (2021) specifically
                        recommends writing the body first (Background and Resolution) before crafting the introduction
                        (Focus and Tension), as this "inside-out" approach helps authors develop clearer tensions after
                        fully understanding their contribution.</p>

                <span class="analysis-label">Q2: Why is assumption challenging better than gap spotting?</span>
                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>Assessment challenging produces stronger theoretical contributions than gap spotting because it
                        questions fundamental premises rather than merely identifying unexplored areas. According to
                        Baird (2021), gap spotting follows the weak logic of "X has been studied, but not in context Y,
                        so let us study X in Y." This approach often leads to incremental contributions that add little
                        to theoretical understanding.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, assumption challenging identifies and questions the taken-for-granted beliefs
                        underlying existing theory. Baird (2021) explains that assumptions operate quietly in the
                        background, and by challenging them, researchers can reveal fundamental flaws in current
                        thinking. For example, rather than studying "technology adoption in healthcare" (gap spotting),
                        assumption challenging would question whether the adoption paradigm itself is appropriate when
                        AI systems operate autonomously.</p>
                    <p>This distinction matters because journals increasingly reject papers with weak contributions. Sun
                        et al. (2024) similarly argue that genuine novelty comes from generating new theoretical
                        perspectives, not from applying existing frameworks to new contexts. They warn that "construct
                        proliferation" and "data mining masquerading as theory" often result from gap spotting
                        approaches. Assumption challenging is more difficult but yields contributions that fundamentally
                        advance the field.</p>

                <span class="analysis-label">Q3: What is the q-r framework, and why is a high-q, low-r paper more
                    salvageable than a low-q, high-r paper?</span>
                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>The q-r framework, introduced by Sarker et al. (2023), evaluates manuscripts along two
                        dimensions: the quality of the underlying idea (q) and the quality of execution or presentation
                        (r). This framework helps reviewers and authors understand that these dimensions are independent
                        and require different types of attention.</p>
                    <p>A high-q, low-r paper has a strong theoretical contribution but poor execution, such as unclear
                        writing, incomplete analysis, or presentation issues. Such papers are more salvageable because
                        the core value proposition exists and can be improved through revision. The authors can work on
                        clarifying their arguments, strengthening their methodology, or improving the writing quality
                        (Sarker et al., 2023).</p>
                    <p>Conversely, a low-q, high-r paper is beautifully written and methodologically sound but lacks a
                        meaningful contribution. No amount of polishing can fix a fundamentally weak idea. As Sarker et
                        al. (2023) note, such papers may appear professional but add little to theoretical or empirical
                        knowledge. This is why senior scholars often advise focusing first on having something important
                        to say before worrying about how to say it. The q-r framework reminds us that substance matters
                        more than style, though both are ultimately necessary for publication.</p>

                    <p>Reviewers must be paradigm-aware because different research paradigms operate under fundamentally

                        leads to unfair and inappropriate reviews.</p>
                    <p>For example, positivist research seeks statistical generalizability and hypothesis testing, while
                        interpretive research aims for deep contextual understanding without claiming universal
                        applicability. A reviewer trained only in positivist methods might incorrectly criticize an
                        interpretive study for lacking statistical power or random sampling, when those criteria are
                        irrelevant to the interpretive paradigm (Sarker et al., 2023).</p>
                    <p>Sun et al. (2024) reinforce this by showing how novelty manifests differently across paradigms.
                        In behavioral research, novelty means new constructs or relationships. In design science, it
                        means new artifacts or design principles. In interpretive research, it means new understanding
                        of situated phenomena. A paradigm-unaware reviewer might fail to recognize legitimate
                        contributions simply because they differ from familiar forms.</p>
                    <p>This awareness is particularly critical given that IS is a pluralistic field embracing multiple
                        research traditions. Paradigm blindness can lead to Type I errors, where good papers are
                        rejected, or Type II errors, where flawed papers are accepted because they superficially match
                        familiar patterns (Sarker et al., 2023).</p>

                    al.?</span>
                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>Sun et al. (2024) identify four significant risks associated with overemphasizing novelty in IS
                        research. First, <strong>construct proliferation</strong> occurs when researchers create new
                        constructs that are conceptually redundant with existing ones, adding to theoretical confusion
                        rather than clarity. The desire to appear novel drives scholars to relabel established concepts
                        rather than building on prior work.</p>
                    <p>Second, <strong>data mining masquerading as theory</strong> happens when researchers analyze data
                        extensively, find statistically significant but theoretically unexplained relationships, and
                        then construct post-hoc theoretical justifications. This reverses the proper relationship
                        between theory and data, making findings appear more theoretically grounded than they actually
                        are.</p>
                    <p>Third, <strong>studying things that do not matter</strong> results from prioritizing novelty over
                        relevance. Researchers may study esoteric phenomena that no one has examined precisely because
                        those phenomena lack practical or theoretical importance. Novelty alone does not equal value.
                    </p>
                    <p>Fourth, <strong>ignoring prior research inappropriately</strong> occurs when authors dismiss
                        relevant literature to make their contribution appear more novel. This intellectual dishonesty
                        harms cumulative knowledge building and often leads to "reinventing the wheel" without
                        acknowledgment.</p>
                    <p>These risks highlight why novelty must be balanced with rigor and relevance, not pursued in
                        isolation (Sun et al., 2024).</p>

                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>Sun et al. (2024) explain that novelty takes different forms depending on the research paradigm,
                        and scholars must evaluate novelty using paradigm-appropriate criteria.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>behavioral research</strong> (positivist paradigm), novelty typically manifests as new
                        constructs, new relationships between existing constructs, new theoretical mechanisms explaining
                        known relationships, or new boundary conditions that specify when relationships hold. The
                        emphasis is on advancing testable, generalizable theory.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>design science research</strong>, novelty appears as new artifacts (tools, systems,
                        methods), new design principles or patterns, or new evaluation frameworks. The contribution lies
                        in demonstrating that an artifact works and generates prescriptive knowledge about how to create
                        effective solutions.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>interpretive research</strong>, novelty emerges through new understanding of
                        particular phenomena in their context, new conceptual frameworks for making sense of complex
                        situations, or new insights into meaning-making processes. The focus is on illuminating rather
                        than predicting.</p>
                    <p>This paradigm-specific understanding of novelty is essential for both authors and reviewers.
                        Authors must demonstrate novelty in ways appropriate to their chosen approach, while reviewers
                        must recognize legitimate novelty even when it differs from familiar forms (Sun et al., 2024).
                        Applying behavioral novelty expectations to design science or interpretive work leads to
                        inappropriate evaluations.</p>

                <span class="analysis-label">Q7: What practical strategies can authors use to demonstrate genuine
                    novelty?</span>
                <div class="success-box">
                    <p>Sun et al. (2024) and Baird (2021) offer several practical strategies for demonstrating genuine
                        novelty in IS research.</p>
                    <p>First, authors should <strong>engage deeply with existing theory</strong> rather than
                        superficially citing prior work. This means understanding the theoretical assumptions, boundary
                        conditions, and limitations of previous research, which enables meaningful extension rather than
                        mere replication in new contexts.</p>
                    <p>Second, <strong>challenge assumptions explicitly</strong>. Identify what existing literature
                        takes for granted and question whether those assumptions hold. As Baird (2021) notes,
                        assumptions operate quietly and rarely get examined, making them fertile ground for theoretical
                        contribution.</p>
                    <p>Third, <strong>borrow from adjacent disciplines thoughtfully</strong>. Importing concepts from
                        sociology, psychology, economics, or philosophy can generate new perspectives, but this requires
                        genuine integration rather than superficial application (Sun et al., 2024).</p>
                    <p>Fourth, <strong>attend to phenomena carefully</strong>. Sun et al. (2024) argue that deep
                        engagement with empirical phenomena often reveals theoretical inadequacies. New technologies
                        like generative AI create genuinely novel situations that existing theories may not adequately
                        explain.</p>
                    <p>Fifth, <strong>position contributions clearly</strong>. Authors must articulate exactly how their
                        work differs from and advances prior literature, making the novelty explicit rather than leaving
                        readers to infer it. This involves both showing what is similar (to establish legitimacy) and
                        what is different (to establish novelty).</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Novelty</strong> refers to generating new theoretical perspectives, concepts, or
                        relationships that advance understanding beyond existing knowledge. <strong>Rigor</strong>
                        involves demonstrating that ideas were developed and tested using appropriate methods for the
                        research paradigm. <strong>Relevance</strong> means the research matters to practitioners,
                        policymakers, or society (Sun et al., 2024).</p>
                    <p>These three desiderata exist in tension. The <strong>novelty-rigor tension</strong> arises
                        because novel ideas may lack established methodological templates. The <strong>novelty-relevance
                            tension</strong> occurs when novel theoretical contributions seem abstract and disconnected
                        from practice. The <strong>rigor-relevance tension</strong> emerges when rigorous methods create
                        findings too narrow or technical for practical application (Sun et al., 2024). Balancing these
                        tensions requires conscious tradeoffs that authors must navigate thoughtfully.</p>

                        <strong>Conferences</strong> like ICIS, AMCIS, and ECIS allow researchers to present
                        work-in-progress, receive feedback, and build networks. They offer faster turnaround and
                        visibility but carry less weight for tenure and promotion (Sun et al., 2024).
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Journals</strong>, particularly those in the AIS Basket of 11 (MISQ, ISR, JAIS, JMIS,

                        publications undergo rigorous peer review, often taking 2-3 years from submission to
                        publication. For PhD students and early-career faculty, building a pipeline of journal
                        publications is critical (Sarker et al., 2023). The strategy is: present at conferences for
                        feedback, then develop into journal submissions.</p>

                    <p>The Financial Times Top 50 (FT50) is a list of academic journals used for ranking business
                        schools based on faculty publications. Only <strong>two IS journals</strong> are included:
                        <strong>MIS Quarterly (MISQ)</strong> and <strong>Information Systems Research (ISR)</strong>.

                    <p><strong>Level of analysis</strong> refers to the unit at which phenomena are studied and
                        theorized. <strong>Individual level</strong> examines how people adopt, use, or are affected by
                        technology, such as TAM or UTAUT studies. <strong>Organizational level</strong> studies how

                    <p><strong>Multi-level</strong> research recognizes that phenomena operate across levels

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>Deep engagement with theory is essential because it enables genuine theoretical contribution
                        rather than superficial application. Baird (2021) argues that researchers must understand not
                        just what prior theories say, but their underlying assumptions, boundary conditions, and
                        limitations. This deep understanding allows researchers to identify meaningful tensions worth
                        addressing.</p>
                    <p>Without deep engagement, researchers risk "construct proliferation," creating new constructs that
                        are conceptually identical to existing ones (Sun et al., 2024). They may also fail to recognize
                        when their findings contradict or extend existing theory in important ways. Deep theoretical
                        engagement also helps position contributions appropriately, showing how new work relates to and
                        advances prior literature. Surface-level citation of theories without genuine understanding
                        leads to weak papers that add little to cumulative knowledge building.</p>

                    <p>Sarker et al. (2023) apply statistical error terminology to the review process:</p>
                    <p><strong>Type I Error (False Positive):</strong> Accepting a paper that should have been rejected.
                        This allows flawed or trivial research into the literature, potentially misleading future
                        researchers and practitioners.</p>
                    <p><strong>Type II Error (False Negative):</strong> Rejecting a paper that should have been
                        accepted. This prevents valuable contributions from reaching the field, potentially discouraging
                        innovative researchers.</p>
                    <p>Both errors are costly to the field. Type I errors pollute the literature; Type II errors impede
                        progress. Reviewers tend toward risk aversion, making Type II errors more common, especially for
                        paradigm-challenging work. Good reviewing requires balancing these risks, being neither too
                        lenient (risking Type I) nor too harsh (risking Type II). The q-r framework helps: high-q papers
                        deserve multiple chances even with execution problems (Sarker et al., 2023).</p>

                    <li><strong>حوزه تمرکز (Focus):</strong> مخاطب شما کیست و چرا باید اهمیت دهند. مثال: "این مقاله برای
